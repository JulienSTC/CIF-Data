{"national_indicator_available":"Proportion of native species ranked secure or apparently secure according to the national extinction risk level","target_name":"No specific target","national_indicator_description":"Canada supports a remarkable diversity of life. About 80 000 species are known to exist in Canada, excluding bacteria and viruses. However, wild species face a variety of threats, including the loss, fragmentation and degradation of habitat; pollution; overexploitation; and fishery bycatch and other incidental loss due to resource harvesting.","national_geographical_coverage":"Canada","computation_calculations":"The main indicator summarizes the risk of extinction for individual species in Canada. A species is defined as a population of organisms that does not usually interbreed with other populations, even where they overlap in space and time. Extinction risks vary across groups, as does the state of knowledge. Non-native species tend to occur more often in some groups than in others. The indicators use data from Wild Species 2015. Every 5 years, a Wild Species report by the Canadian Endangered Species Conservation Council provides information on a large number of Canadian wild species to assess the general status of species and species groups. This information can reveal early signs of trouble before species reach a critical condition.","comments_limitations":null,"rationale_interpretation":"The indicators provide a measure of extinction risk and an indication of the overall state of biodiversity in Canada, since the loss of a species is a loss of biodiversity. The leading cause of biodiversity loss in Canada and around the world is the loss of habitat to human development. Direct threats such as habitat loss and overharvest can be mitigated through actions such as habitat protection and harvest regulation. Wild species also face the indirect effects of human activities, including invasive species, new diseases, and climate change. Exotic species can become invasive and alter how ecosystems function.","graph_title":"Proportion of native species ranked secure or apparently secure, by species","graph_type":"bar","computation_units":"Percentage","data_start_values":[{"field":"Species group","value":"Mammals"},{"field":"Species group","value":"Birds"},{"field":"Species group","value":"Reptiles"},{"field":"Species group","value":"Amphibians"},{"field":"Species group","value":"Fishes"},{"field":"Species group","value":"Corals"},{"field":"Species group","value":"Bees"},{"field":"Species group","value":"Dragonflies and damselflies"},{"field":"Species group","value":"Moths and butterflies"}],"indicator_name":"Proportion of native species ranked secure or apparently secure according to the national extinction risk level","indicator_sort_order":"15-1-01","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","indicator_number":"15.1.1","sdg_goal":"15","data_non_statistical":false,"target_id":"15.1","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Statistics Canada.
