Results are generalized to provide a snapshot of an environmental condition on the landscape at a given time. The calculations and models for each indicator differ considerably, but all mathematical models and formulas have been adapted or developed from solid scientific knowledge and understanding of the interactions between various aspects of agricultural practices and the environment.","rationale_interpretation":"Everyone in Canada should have access to safe, clean drinking water.
